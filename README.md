# FreeCodeCamp's Recipe Box
This is the eighth take home project in FreeCodeCamp's Coding Interview Prep where we have to create a recipe box where users can create, edit, delete, and keep recipes that have names, ingridients, and directions.

## Application Usage
When starting the application for the first time, users will have a default starting list of recipes stored in their browser's local storage.  
  
Users can create, edit, and delete any of the recipes. The changes will be saved to the browser's local storage.  
  
Users can also search for recipes by clicking the recipe's name in the index view located at the top part.  
  
When cloning this repository, here are the steps to start the application:  
1. npm install
2. npm start
